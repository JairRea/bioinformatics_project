# AI Usage Documentation

This project utilized AI assistance in a heavy capacity to enhance development efficiency and code quality. Below is a comprehensive summary of how AI was integrated into the project workflow:

## Code Development
- AI assisted in generating skeleton code and pseudocode for machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression)
- Helped structure code organization and modular design for better maintainability
- Provided guidance on Python library selection and implementation
- Assisted with debugging syntax errors and code cleanup

## Data Processing
- Aided in implementing data preprocessing pipelines for both datasets
- Helped identify and remove duplicate rows from the General Diabetes dataset
- Assisted with handling missing values in the Pima Indians dataset

## Visualization & Figures
- AI was used to generate workflow diagrams and pipeline visualizations for presentations
- Assisted in creating comprehensive model performance visualizations (confusion matrices, ROC curves, feature importance plots)
- Helped design publication-ready figures with proper formatting and labels

## Documentation
- Assisted with APA-style citation formatting and bibliography organization
- Helped clarify and improve wording in project documentation
- Provided guidance on interpreting model statistics and performance metrics

## Project Organization
- Aided in establishing consistent naming conventions across files and folders
- Helped organize documentation into structured directories
- Assisted with version control commit messages and project structure

**Note:** While AI provided valuable assistance throughout this project, all final implementations, analyses, and interpretations were reviewed and validated
